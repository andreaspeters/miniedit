## LSP

There is no "one fix all" LSP Server. That means, for every programming
language, you have to install it's own LSP Server. ðŸ˜” Currently, MiniEdit
does support only LSP for Golang via `gopls`. Be sure that it is installed
and in one of your PATH directories therefore MiniEdit can find it.

- ALT+. (PERIOD) will open the LSP window for code completion. But only if the
LSP Server could find any information.
- ALT+- (MINUS) - on a package name (as example `import "fmt"`) will open the
LSP window with a description to these package. But again, only if the LSP
Server could find any information about that.

## Thanks

- MiniEdit is based on ovotext from [Marco Caselli](https://github.com/varianus/ovotext/). It was a perfect "template" to create
my own Dev-Editor with all the features I need and all the shortcuts my fingers like to have. :-) Thanks to you Marco.
- My own Syntax highligthing files are using [SynFacilBasic](https://github.com/t-edson/SynFacilSyn) from Por Tito Hinostroza.
It's a great way to create own Syntax highligthing files for SynEdit. So, also many thanks to him.
